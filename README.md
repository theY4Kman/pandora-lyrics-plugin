Lyrics Plug-in
==============

This is a very basic plug-in to display lyrics for songs now playing on [zzj's pandora client](http://ridetheclown.com/wp/saver2/).


Installation
------------

1. Copy `LyricsPlugin.dll` (and maybe `HtmlAgilityPack.dll`?) into your *Pandora* or *Saver2* directory.

2. Click *Menu* in the pandora window, and select *Configuration*:

4. Inside the text box labeled *Plugins to load*, enter `;LyricsPlugin.dll` (that's a semi-colon followed by "LyricsPlugin.dll"), and hit *Apply* or *Okay*:
